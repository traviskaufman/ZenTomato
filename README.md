# ZenTomato

<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="./public/logo192.png" alt="logo" style="text-align:center;"></div>

ZenTomato is a minimal, elegant, and frictionless [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) timer designed
to make you feel good about being productive.

I use Pomodoro technique all the time, but most of the ones I found online were either very clunky
to use, or just were loaded with things I didn't need. I'm a big fan of [calm technology](https://calmtech.com) and I asked myself:

> What would a pomodoro timer that was designed with calm technology in mind look like?

And thus ZenTomato was born.

An equal goal of mine in building this was to practice my React skills while exercising some excess creative energy. I'm happy to say that for me personally, ZenTomato has now become my de facto pomodoro app of choice...but I guess I'm biased :wink:

The code is a complete spaghetti nightmare mess right now :sweat_smile:, but I plan on refactoring it soon and then
writing about my experience building this!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
